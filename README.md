# Python Chess Engine

This project is about three chess engines (Python Machine Learning Chess Engine) based
on machine learning, and more specifically on reinforcement and supervised learning, as
well as an online application that allows the user to play against the chess engines, 
but also to watch them play against each other. The chess engines were 
developed using Python programming language. In total, three different game models 
were created, a model that was trained by playing games against itself, a model that 
was trained with data from past professional games stored in online databases and a 
combinational model that was trained using both methods. The enginesâ€™ choice of 
move is made using Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is a heuristic algorithm for certain 
types of decision-making processes. In addition, a web application was created that 
allows the user to play against the engines, but also to watch the engines play against 
each other. The results highlight the usefulness of machine learning in complex 
problems, without any prior knowledge of the strategy and characteristics of the 
problem, but also without the need for human analysis of their parameters.
